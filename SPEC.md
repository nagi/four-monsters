# 4 Monster Game Website

The 4 Monster game (working title) has 4 monsters.

  * Red
  * Blue
  * Green
  * Yellow

We don't know much about the game yet, but want to begin fleshing out it's website.

The website should have five pages:

1) An index page which links to the 4 monster pages. It should have a title and 4 links.
2) A page for each moster, with a title something like "Red Monster" etc

## Players

Although we haven't created the game yet, we want to allow interested users to
enter their email to sign up for marketing emails etc

The homepage should have a box where users can enter their email.
